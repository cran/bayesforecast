Automatic forecasting and Bayesian modeling for time series
===========================================================

The *bayesforecast* package implements Bayesian estimation of structured
time series models, using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method,
implemented with [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), a probabilistic language
model in C++. The aim of this package is to provide an interface for
forecasting and Bayesian modeling of the most popular time series
models.

On the beta version 1.0.0, the available models are:

-   ARIMA [Box and
    Jenkins (1970)](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Time+Series+Analysis%3A+Forecasting+and+Control%2C+5th+Edition-p-9781118675021).
-   Multiplicative Seasonal ARIMA [Brockwell and
    Davis (2016)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/3319298526/ref=cm_sw_su_dp?tag=otexts-20)
-   GARCH
    [Bollerslev (1986)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-4076(86)90063-1)
-   Asymmetric GARCH [Fonseca et.
    al (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01398)
-   ARMAX
    [Pankratz (1991)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0471615285/ref=cm_sw_su_dp?tag=otexts-20)
-   Dynamic Harmonic regression
    [Pankratz (1991)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0471615285/ref=cm_sw_su_dp?tag=otexts-20)
-   Stochastic Volatility models [Sangjoon et.
    al. (1998)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2566931)
-   Local global trend [Ng et. al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08492)
-   Additive ETS models from the
    [forecast package](https://github.com/robjhyndman/forecast). [Rob and
    Khandakar (2008)](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v027i03)
    -   Local level models
    -   Holt’s linear trend
    -   Holt-Winter’s

Additionally the forecast function is implemented for automatic
forecast, by default a Generalized additive model from the
[prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/installation.html#r)
package is used.

### Installation

This is still a beta version package, so currently installing it could
be challenging, we recommend to install the current R version (**R4.0**)
and the **Rtools4.0**. After that, install the package
[rstan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan.html), you can follow
the installation procedure
[here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started)

### Installation from Github

For installing *bayesforecast* package from Github, use the code on the
next chunk:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("asael697/bayesforecast",dependencies = TRUE)
```

### Case study: Analyzing the monthly live birth in U.S. an example

As an example, we provide a time series modeling for the monthly live
births in the United States 1948-1979, published by [Stoffer
(2019)](https://github.com/nickpoison/astsa). In **figure 1** , the data
has a seasonal behavior that repeats every year. The series *waves* in
the whole 40 years period (*superior part*). In addition, the partial
(*pacf*) and auto-correlation (*acf*) functions are far from zero
(*middle part*). After applying a difference to the data, the acf and
pacf plots still have some non-zero values every 12 lags (*inferior
part*).

For start, a multiplicative Seasonal ARIMA model could give a good fit
to the data, following [Tsay
(2010)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/047136164X/ref=cm_sw_su_dp?tag=otexts-20)
recommendations for order selection using the auto-correlation
functions, we define (p = 1, d = 1, q = 1) and for the seasonal part (P=
1, D = 1 and Q = 1). The fitted model is defined as follows

``` r
sf1 = stan_sarima(ts = birth,order = c(1,1,1),seasonal = c(1,1,1),
                  prior_mu0 = student(mu = 0,sd = 1,df = 7))
```

All fitted models are *varstan* objects, these are S3 classes with the
*stanfit* results provided by the
[rstan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan.html) package, and
other useful elements that make the modeling process easier.

``` r

After fitting our model we can make a visual diagnostic of our
parameters, check residuals and fitted values using the plot method. The
package provides the posterior sample of every residual, but checking
all of them is an exhausting task. An alternative, is checking the
process generated by the residuals posterior estimate.

``` r
check_residuals(sf1)
```

A white noise behavior indicates a good model fit. The model’s residuals
in figure 2, seems to follow a random noise, the auto-correlation in
*acf plots* quickly falls to zero, indicating an acceptable model fit.
Finally a forecast of the for the next year can be performed as:

``` r
autoplot(forecast(object = sf1,h = 12))
```

### Automatic forecast with prophet

Automatic prediction is possible using the **forecast** function, by
default the prediction is done using Generalized additive models from
the
[prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html#python-api)
package.

``` r
library(astsa)
autoplot(object = forecast(cardox,h = 12),include = 100)
```
